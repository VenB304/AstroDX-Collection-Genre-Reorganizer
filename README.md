is able to categorize all the available charts for AstroDX as of September 5, 2024

## Description

This project automates the sorting and categorization of maimai song charts into their respective genres based on a JSON mapping file. The script parses folders and files, identifies genre categories from chart data, and organizes them into specific directories. Unidentified charts are either logged or manually categorized by the user.

## Features
- Generate Manifest Files
  - Automatically create manifest.json files for each directory, with optional GUID appending.
- Customizable Chart Sorting
  - Organizes song charts into genres based on provided data in a JSON file or manual input.
- Unidentified Handler
  - Allows users to decide how to process folders that donâ€™t match known genres by either copying them to an unidentified folder, logging them, or assigning them manually.
- Support for Manual and Automated Classification
  - The script uses both automatic matching against JSON data and manual input for unidentified items.
